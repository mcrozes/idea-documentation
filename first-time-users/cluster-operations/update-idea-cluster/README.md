# Update IDEA cluster

Follow the guides below based on the type of update you want to apply to your IDEA cluster:

* [patch-idea-module.md](patch-idea-module.md "mention") if you have updated the codebase of one of your module
* Config Change if you want to make a configuration change
* Deploy Change if you have made an architecture update outside of IDEA codebase (e.g: updated Lambda function)
